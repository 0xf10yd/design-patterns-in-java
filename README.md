## Design Patterns Examples in Java

To import the Exercise Files into Eclipse:

1. Open Eclipse.
2. Select File > Import > General > Existing Projects in Workspace.
3. Click Next.
4. In "Select root directory", browse to and select the folder you just created on the desktop.
5. Click Finish.

This will create a new project folder in your Eclipse Package Explorer. To see the same view that we used in the course, choose:
Navigator > Show In > Navigator
and open the folder using the arrows. You should see all the Java source files in the src/ folder.

> Remember to "Run as" a Java application when running the code.
